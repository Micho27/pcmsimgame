# What is this?

A friend of mine uses pro cycling manager to simulate a cycling racing season with each participant managin one team. This is a site I built to help keep track of the standings and race days used without the need to share access to excel files and google sheets.
It is all pretty basic but i hope one day it will turn into something cool that maybe other groups will be able to use to run their own
races with.
